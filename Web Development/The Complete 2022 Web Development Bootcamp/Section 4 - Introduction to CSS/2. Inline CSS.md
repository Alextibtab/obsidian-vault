# Notes
Inline CSS is where every time you want to style a HTML element you use the "style" attribute on the HTML tag to write your CSS code while this might work for smaller pages it isn't practical for bigger websites and if you want to style all the \<h1> tags on a page you'd end up having to copy and paste the same code throughout the file. 

example of styling a \<h1> element
```html
<h1 style="font-size: 48px;letter-spacing: 8px;color: white;">Hello World!</h1>
```
```ad-success
<h1 style="font-size: 48px;letter-spacing: 8px;color: white;">Hello World!</h1>
```
