# Notes
The \<img> tag is a self closing tag and required the "src" attribute to be set to either a image URL or system path to an image. The image will then be displayed on the webpage. Another attribute that the \<img> tag should have is the "alt" attribute which is a text description of what the image represents which helps with SEO and accessibility.
```html
<img src="bird.jpg" alt="picture of bird">
```

```ad-success
<img src="./bird.jpg">
```
