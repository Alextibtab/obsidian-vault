# Notes
When creating HTML files there is a certain structure that should always be followed this is called "boilerplate" because it is identical code that will be in every HTML file and there is often extensions or plugins built into IDEs that will insert this for you.

#### Example Boilerplate
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8">
		<title></title>
	</head>
	<body>
	</body>
</html>
```
