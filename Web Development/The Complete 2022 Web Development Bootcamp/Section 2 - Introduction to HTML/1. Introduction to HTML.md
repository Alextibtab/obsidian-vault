# Notes
HTML = HyperText Markup Language and are based off the markup that would be put into manuscripts where editors would mock up the manuscript and either specify changes to the author or specify structure and layout to the publishers. So you might write a squiggle under a line indicating to the publisher that you want this word printed out in bold. HTML works the same you can use tags to specify the layour and structure of the website.

To create a header tag you use the following syntax
```
```
```html
<h1>Heading</h1>
```
