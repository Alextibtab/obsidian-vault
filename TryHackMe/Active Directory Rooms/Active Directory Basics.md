# Windows Active Directory Basics
## Windows Domains
A windows domain is a group of users and computers under the administration of a given business. The main idea behind a domain is to centralise the administration of common components of a windows network into a single repository called **Active Directory (AD)**. The server that runs the active directory services is known as a **Domain Controller (DC)**.

The main advantages of having a configured windows domain are:
- **Centralised Identity Management**: All users across the network can be configured from Active Directory with minimum effort,
- **Managing Security Policies**: You can configure security policies directly from Active Directory and apply them to users and computers across the network as needed.
