# TMUX learning
Tmux is a multiplexer. That allows you to craft a single terminal however you need it.

## Creating TMUX sessions
To launch tmux simply run the command below
```bash
tmux
```
when tmux launches the session is automatically called "0" if you want to change the session name to something more meaningful you can use the following keyboard command `Ctrl + b Shift + $` every tmux command will start with the same prefix of `Ctrl + b`
