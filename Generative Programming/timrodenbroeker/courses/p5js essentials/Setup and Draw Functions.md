# Notes
The foundation of any Processing or P5.js sketch is based on two functions: `setup()` and `draw()`. In short, `setup()` defines the project-details whereas `draw()` defines what happens over time

```javascript
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
  background(220);
}
```
The above javascript code is the default code provided when creating a new sketch in P5.js
